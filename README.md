# 3D Satellite Information Dashboard

This project is to provide an interactive 3D Earth website that provides the user with 
information about the various satellite that surrounds the Earth

For this project I will be using React + Vite
 - Three.js is used to render 3D models 
 - Tailwind CSS will be used because better styling
 - React because I have the most experience with it the goal is to make the UI with this
    - Vite is a tool for faster React app development because it reloads only the changes it needs to instead of rebuilding everything

Instructions for making a local instance of this project will be detailed below
you may require an API key from NASA, ```https://api.nasa.gov/```
